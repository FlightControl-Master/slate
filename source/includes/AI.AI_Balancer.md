# AI.AI_Balancer Module
Single-Player:**No** / Multi-Player:**Yes** / AI:**Yes** / Human:**No** / Types:**All** -- **AI Balancing will replace in multi player missions
non-occupied human slots with AI groups, in order to provide an engaging simulation environment,
even when there are hardly any players in the mission.**

Hereby the change log:

2017-01-17: There is still a problem with AI being destroyed, but not respawned. Need to check further upon that.

#####  **AUTHORS and CONTRIBUTIONS**

#####  Contributions:

* **[Dutch_Baron](https://forums.eagle.ru/member.php?u=112075)**: Working together with James has resulted in the creation of the AI_BALANCER class. James has shared his ideas on balancing AI with air units, and together we made a first design which you can use now :-)
* **SNAFU**: Had a couple of mails with the guys to validate, if the same concept in the GCI/CAP script could be reworked within MOOSE. None of the script code has been used however within the new AI_BALANCER moose class.

## AI_BALANCER Class
<pre>
Inheritance : The AI_BALANCER Class inherits from the following parents :
BASE
	`-- FSM
		`-- FSM_SET
			`-- AI_BALANCER
</pre>

The AI_BALANCER class monitors and manages as many replacement AI groups as there are
CLIENTS in a SET_CLIENT collection, which are not occupied by human players.
In other words, use AI_BALANCER to simulate human behaviour by spawning in replacement AI in multi player missions.

The parent class [FSM_SET](#fsm_set-class) manages the functionality to control the Finite State Machine (FSM).
The mission designer can tailor the behaviour of the AI_BALANCER, by defining event and state transition methods.
An explanation about state and event transition methods can be found in the [FSM](#fsm-module) module documentation.

The mission designer can tailor the AI_BALANCER behaviour, by implementing a state or event handling method for the following:

* AI_BALANCER-OnAfterSpawned AISet, From, Event, To, AIGroup ): Define to add extra logic when an AI is spawned.

#####  1. AI_BALANCER construction

Create a new AI_BALANCER object with the [AI_BALANCER:New()](#ai_balancer-new-setclient-spawnai) method:

#####  2. AI_BALANCER is a FSM

![Process](/includes/Pictures/AI_Balancer/Dia13.JPG)

#####  2.1. AI_BALANCER States

* **Monitoring** ( Set ): Monitoring the Set if all AI is spawned for the Clients.
* **Spawning** ( Set, ClientName ): There is a new AI group spawned with ClientName as the name of reference.
* **Spawned** ( Set, AIGroup ): A new AI has been spawned. You can handle this event to customize the AI behaviour with other AI FSMs or own processes.
* **Destroying** ( Set, AIGroup ): The AI is being destroyed.
* **Returning** ( Set, AIGroup ): The AI is returning to the airbase specified by the ReturnToAirbase methods. Handle this state to customize the return behaviour of the AI, if any.

#####  2.2. AI_BALANCER Events

* **Monitor** ( Set ): Every 10 seconds, the Monitor event is triggered to monitor the Set.
* **Spawn** ( Set, ClientName ): Triggers when there is a new AI group to be spawned with ClientName as the name of reference.
* **Spawned** ( Set, AIGroup ): Triggers when a new AI has been spawned. You can handle this event to customize the AI behaviour with other AI FSMs or own processes.
* **Destroy** ( Set, AIGroup ): The AI is being destroyed.
* **Return** ( Set, AIGroup ): The AI is returning to the airbase specified by the ReturnToAirbase methods.

#####  3. AI_BALANCER spawn interval for replacement AI

Use the method [AI_BALANCER:InitSpawnInterval()](#ai_balancer-initspawninterval-earliest-latest) to set the earliest and latest interval in seconds that is waited until a new replacement AI is spawned.

#####  4. AI_BALANCER returns AI to Airbases

By default, When a human player joins a slot that is AI_BALANCED, the AI group will be destroyed by default.
However, there are 2 additional options that you can use to customize the destroy behaviour.
When a human player joins a slot, you can configure to let the AI return to:

* [AI_BALANCER:ReturnToHomeAirbase()](#ai_balancer-returntohomeairbase-returntresholdrange): Returns the AI to the **home** [AIRBASE](#airbase-class).
* [AI_BALANCER:ReturnToNearestAirbases()](#ai_balancer-returntonearestairbases-returntresholdrange-returnairbaseset): Returns the AI to the **nearest friendly** [AIRBASE](#airbase-class).

Note that when AI returns to an airbase, the AI_BALANCER will trigger the **Return** event and the AI will return,
otherwise the AI_BALANCER will trigger a **Destroy** event, and the AI will be destroyed.
