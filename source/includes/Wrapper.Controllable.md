# Wrapper.Controllable Module
This module contains the CONTROLLABLE class.

##### 1) [CONTROLLABLE](#controllable-class) class, extends [POSITIONABLE](#positionable-class)

The [CONTROLLABLE](#controllable-class) class is a wrapper class to handle the DCS Controllable objects:

* Support all DCS Controllable APIs.
* Enhance with Controllable specific APIs not in the DCS Controllable API set.
* Handle local Controllable Controller.
* Manage the "state" of the DCS Controllable.

##### 1.1) CONTROLLABLE constructor

The CONTROLLABLE class provides the following functions to construct a CONTROLLABLE instance:

* [CONTROLLABLE:New()](#controllable-new-controllablename): Create a CONTROLLABLE instance.

##### 1.2) CONTROLLABLE task methods

Several controllable task methods are available that help you to prepare tasks.
These methods return a string consisting of the task description, which can then be given to either a [CONTROLLABLE:PushTask()](#controllable-pushtask) or @{Controllable#SetTask} method to assign the task to the CONTROLLABLE.
Tasks are specific for the category of the CONTROLLABLE, more specific, for AIR, GROUND or AIR and GROUND.
Each task description where applicable indicates for which controllable category the task is valid.
There are 2 main subdivisions of tasks: Assigned tasks and EnRoute tasks.

#####  1.2.1) Assigned task methods

Assigned task methods make the controllable execute the task where the location of the (possible) targets of the task are known before being detected.
This is different from the EnRoute tasks, where the targets of the task need to be detected before the task can be executed.

Find below a list of the **assigned task** methods:

* [CONTROLLABLE:TaskAttackGroup()](#controllable-taskattackgroup-attackgroup-weapontype-weaponexpend-attackqty-direction-altitude-attackqtylimit): (AIR) Attack a Controllable.

### CONTROLLABLE:EnRouteTaskEngageGroup(AttackGroup, Priority, WeaponType, WeaponExpend, AttackQty, Direction, Altitude, AttackQtyLimit)

<h4> Parameters </h4>
* [CONTROLLABLE](#controllable-class)
self
* [CONTROLLABLE](#controllable-class) AttackGroup : The Controllable to be attacked.
* <u>Number</u> Priority : All en-route tasks have the priority parameter. This is a number (less value - higher priority) that determines actions related to what task will be performed first.
* <u>Number</u> WeaponType : (optional) Bitmask of weapon types those allowed to use. If parameter is not defined that means no limits on weapon usage.
* [AI.Task.WeaponExpend](#ai.task.weaponexpend-class) WeaponExpend : (optional) Determines how much weapon will be released at each attack. If parameter is not defined the unit / controllable will choose expend on its own discretion.
* <u>Number</u> AttackQty : (optional) This parameter limits maximal quantity of attack. The aicraft/controllable will not make more attack than allowed even if the target controllable not destroyed and the aicraft/controllable still have ammo. If not defined the aircraft/controllable will attack target until it will be destroyed or until the aircraft/controllable will run out of ammo.
* [Azimuth](#azimuth-class) Direction : (optional) Desired ingress direction from the target to the attacking aircraft. Controllable/aircraft will make its attacks from the direction. Of course if there is no way to attack from the direction due the terrain controllable/aircraft will choose another direction.
* [Distance](#distance-class) Altitude : (optional) Desired attack start altitude. Controllable/aircraft will make its attacks from the altitude. If the altitude is too low or too high to use weapon aircraft/controllable will choose closest altitude to the desired attack start altitude. If the desired altitude is defined controllable/aircraft will not attack from safe altitude.
* <u>Boolean</u> AttackQtyLimit : (optional) The flag determines how to interpret attackQty parameter. If the flag is true then attackQty is a limit on maximal attack quantity for "AttackGroup" and "AttackUnit" tasks. If the flag is false then attackQty is a desired attack quantity for "Bombing" and "BombingRunway" tasks.
